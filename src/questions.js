    text: "What is the top-level interface in the Java collection hierarchy?",
    options: ["List", "Set", "Queue", "Collection"],
    answer: "Collection",
    explanation:
      "The Collection interface is the top-level interface in the Java collection hierarchy, and it provides the basic functionality that all collections should have.",
  },
  {
    text: "Which of the following is NOT a sub-interface of Collection?",
    options: ["List", "Map", "Set", "Queue"],
    answer: "Map",
    explanation:
      "Map is not a sub-interface of Collection. Instead, Map is a separate interface that defines a collection of key-value pairs.",
  },
  // {
  //   text: "Which interface is used to define an ordered collection that allows duplicates?",
  //   options: ["Set", "Queue", "Map", "List"],
  //   answer: "List",
  //   explanation:
  //     "The List interface is used to define an ordered collection that allows duplicates. Elements in a List are stored in a specific order, and can be accessed using an index.",
  // },
  // {
  //   text: "Which interface is used to define a collection of key-value pairs?",
  //   options: ["Set", "Queue", "Map", "List"],
  //   answer: "Map",
  //   explanation:
  //     "The Map interface is used to define a collection of key-value pairs. In a Map, each element is a key-value pair, where each key is unique.",
  // },
  // {
  //   text: "Which of the following is a concrete implementation of the Set interface that maintains its elements in a sorted order?",
  //   options: ["HashSet", "TreeSet", "LinkedHashSet", "ArraySet"],
  //   answer: "TreeSet",
  //   explanation:
  //     "TreeSet is a concrete implementation of the Set interface that maintains its elements in a sorted order. The elements in a TreeSet are stored in a red-black tree, which ensures that they are always ordered.",
  // },
  // {
  //   text: "Which interface is used to define a collection that stores elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order?",
  //   options: ["List", "Queue", "Deque", "Set"],
  //   answer: "Deque",
  //   explanation:
  //     "The Deque interface is used to define a collection that stores elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. Elements can be added or removed from either end of the deque.",
  // },
  // {
  //   text: "Which interface is used to define a collection that stores elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order?",
  //   options: ["List", "Queue", "Deque", "Set"],
  //   answer: "Queue",
  //   explanation:
  //     "The Queue interface is used to define a collection that stores elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. Elements can be added to the end of the queue, and removed from the front of the queue.",
  // },
  // {
  //   text: "Which of the following is a concrete implementation of the Set interface that maintains the order in which elements were added?",
  //   options: ["HashSet", "TreeSet", "LinkedHashSet", "ArraySet"],
  //   answer: "LinkedHashSet",
  //   explanation:
  //     "LinkedHashSet is a concrete implementation of the Set interface that maintains the order in which elements were added. Elements in a LinkedHashSet are stored in a hash table, which allows for constant-time performance for add, remove, and contains operations, while also preserving the order of insertion.",
  // },
  // {
  //   text: "Which method in the Collection interface is used to remove all elements from a collection?",
  //   options: ["clear()", "removeAll()", "deleteAll()", "empty()"],
  //   answer: "clear()",
  //   explanation:
  //     "The clear() method in the Collection interface is used to remove all elements from a collection. This method does not remove the collection itself, but simply removes all of its elements. The other options are not valid methods in the Collection interface.",
  // },
